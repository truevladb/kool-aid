# Kool Bar
ERC-1155-based vending smart-contract which is generating new ERC-1155 tokens (NFTs) of various kinds in exchange for ERC-20 and other ERC-1155 tokens (NFTs). You can collect limited Kool-Aid flavours and mix them into rare NFT cocktails. It's the first bar where you're not allowed to drink.

**KOOL BAR**
The Kool Bar includes NFT flavors of different rarity: Common, Uncommon, Rare and Super Rare. Flavors are seasonal, however some may reappear as mixing ingredients in the future seasons. Common flavors are being sold for AID. Uncommon, Rare and Super Rare can only be obtained via mixing.

**Kool Mixing**
Each time you mix a new cocktail its ingredientsâ€™ NFTz get burnt and therefor become scarcer. In some scenarios certain Common flavors may become even scarcer than Rare ones!
